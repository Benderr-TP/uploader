Uploader\n\nThis is a Chrome App that acts as an uploader client for Tidepool. It is intended to allow you to plug diabetes devices into your computer's USB port, read the data stored on them, and upload a standardized version of the data to the Tidepool cloud.\nThis README is focused on just the details of getting the uploader running locally. For more detailed information aimed at those working on the development of the uploader, please see the developer guide.\nTable of contents\n\nSet Up\nConfig\nTests\nLinting & Code Style\nDocs\nPublishing\n\n\nHow to set it up\n\nClone this repository.\nRun npm install\nSet the config for the environment you want to target (see Config below)\nRun npm start (This will bundle the application with webpack and watch for changes. When it stops printing output you can continue to the next step.)\nOpen Chrome. Go to chrome://extensions and turn on Developer mode (checkbox on the top line).\nClick \"Load Unpacked Extension\".\nChoose the directory where you cloned the repository and click OK. (You may see a warning from Chrome concerning the inclusion of a key file. (This extension includes the key file '/node_modules/webpack-dev-server/node_modules/sockjs-client/node_modules/eventsource/test/key.pem) This is due to the loading of all the node_modules and their various internal testing utilities. This isn't a security issue, nor is the associated key used or referenced anywhere in the running code and can safely be ignored.)\nTo run it, you can choose \"Launch\" from the chrome://extensions page. You can also run it from the Chrome App Launcher, which Chrome may install for you whether you want it or not.\nTo open the JavaScript console/Chrome Dev Tools, click on the index.html link in the section of chrome://extensions devoted to the uploader. (Note: this link will only appear after you've launched the uploader.)\nReact components and CSS will hot load after changes (this can be confirmed by watching the JavaScript console), but changes to device drivers and other code outside of the React components will not - use 'Reload' from chrome://extensions to reload after such changes. If the compilation/hot reload of a component fails for any reason (e.g. from a syntax error) you may need to reinitialize the hot loader by reloading the extension. You will definitely need to reload any time you change the manifest.\n\nConfig\nConfiguration values (for example the URL of the Tidepool Platform) are set via environment variables. If you need to add a config value, modify the .config.js file. If you need to read a config value inside the app, use var config = require('./lib/config'). To set config values (do this before building the app), you can use Shell scripts that export environment variables (see config/local.sh for an example that exports the appropriate variables when running the whole Tidepool platform locally using runservers), for example:\n$ source config/local.sh\n$ npm start\n\nDebug Mode(s)\nFor ease of development we have several debug features that developers can turn on and off at will (and to suit various development use cases, such as working on a new device driver versus working on the app's UI). Each of these debug features is set with an environment variable, but rather than being loaded through .config.js (as we do for production configuration variables, see above), we load these through the webpack DefinePlugin (see Pete Hunt's webpack-howto for an example, although note Hunt uses the term 'feature flag').\nDEBUG_ERROR\nThe environment variable DEBUG_ERROR (boolean) controls whether or not errors sourced in device drivers are caught and an error message displayed in the UI (the production setting) or whether they are thrown in the console (much more useful for local development because then the file name and line number of the error are easily accessible, along with a stack trace). DEBUG_ERROR mode is turned on by default in config/device-debug.sh.\nREDUX_LOG\nThe environment variable REDUX_LOG (boolean) controls whether or not the redux logger middleware is included. This middleware logs all redux actions in the Chrome developer console, including the (entire) previous and following app state trees. It is primarily useful when working on the UI of the app, and in fact can be quite performance-expensive (especially when uploading a device, due to the fact that every update to the progress bar constitutes an action), so it is not recommended to turn it on while working on device code.\nREDUX_DEV_UI\nThe environment variable REDUX_DEV_UI (boolean) controls whether or not the redux dev tools UI is included. The redux dev tools add a UI interface for exploring - and, to a limited extent, manipulating - app actions and state. Even when REDUX_DEV_UI is true, we have the dev tools hidden by default: the key combination ctrl + h will toggle their visibility. The key combination ctrl + q will rotate (clockwise) the location at which the dev tools are anchored; the default is for them to be anchored at the bottom of the app. Similarly to the redux logger middleware, the redux dev tools UI is also quite performance expensive and only recommended for use while working on UI code.\nREDUX_LOG and REDUX_DEV_UI are both turned on by default in config/ui-debug.sh.\nLocal Development w/o Debug Mode(s)\nAll debug options are turned off by default in config/local.sh.\nTests\nThere are two sets of (unit) tests for the code in this repository.\nThe tests for all device and data-processing code currently run in the nodejs server-side JavaScript environment. (We plan to eventually migrate these tests to run in-browser since the code itself runs in-browser in the Chrome App.)\nThe tests for all the UI code run using the Karma test runner in the headless WebKit browser PhantomJS or the Chrome browser.\nTo run the tests in this repository as they are run on Travis CI, use:\n$ npm test\n\nTo run just the UI tests in both PhantomJS and Chrome locally, use:\n$ npm run browser-tests\n\nTo run just the device and data-processing tests in node, use:\n$ npm run node-tests\n\nTo run just the UI tests in PhantomJS with webpack & Karma watching all files for changes and both rebundling the app and re-running the tests on every change, use:\n$ npm run test-watch\n\nLinting & Code Style\nWe use ESLint to lint our JavaScript code. We try to use the same linting options across all our client apps, but there are a few exceptions in this application, noted with comments in the .eslintrc configuration file.\nTo run the linter (which also runs on Travis CI with every push, along with npm test), use:\n$ npm run lint\nAside from the (fairly minimal) JavaScript code style options we enforce through the linter, we ask that internal developers and external contributors try to match the style of the code in each module being modified. New modules should look to similar modules for style guidance. In React component code, use existing ES6/ES2015 components (not legacy ES5 components) as the style model for new components.\nNB: Please keep ES5 and ES6/ES2015 code distinct. Do NOT use ES6/ES2105 features in ES5 modules (most easily recognizable by the use of require rather than import).\nDocs\nDocs reside in several places in this repository, such as docs/ and lib/drivers/docs. They are built as a static site with GitBook and served at developer.tidepool.io/ via GitHub Pages.\nSee this guidance on our use of GitBook at Tidepool.\nPublishing (to the devel/staging testing & development Chrome store account or production)\nWhen you're ready to merge your pull request, first\n\nUse the command mversion minor -m to bump the version number and create a tag. (You will need to npm install -g mversion if you don't have mversion installed already.)\nPush the new tag commit and tag up to GitHub with git push origin  and git push origin --tags.\nMerge your approved pull request.\n\nAssuming you've already merged any changes to master and are on master locally...\n\nStart with a fresh Terminal window and cd into the chrome-uploader repo. (Alternatively, just make certain you haven't set any environment variables locally; but jebeck likes to start fresh to be absolutely certain of this.)\nCheckout the tag you wish to build, using git checkout tags/.\nRemove your node modules with rm -rf node_modules/. (This may not always be necessary, but it's good to be safe in case anything has changed.)\nMake sure you are using node v0.12.7 and install fresh dependencies with npm install.\nBuild the dist.zip file with npm run build. Look for the \"Using the default environment, which is now production\" message at the beginning of the build process. (You can check the success of a build (prior to publishing) by pointing 'Load unpacked extension' from chrome://extensions to the dist/ subdir.)\nFollow instructions in secrets for actually publishing to the Chrome store.\nFill out the release notes for the tag on GitHub and attach dist.zip to your notes. This is so that if you built for the development Chrome store, you can then distribute the same dist.zip to the production Chrome store without having to rebuild everything. If the tag is known to not be a release candidate, mark it as a pre-release.\n\n"},"docs/StartHere.html":{"url":"docs/StartHere.html","title":"Tidepool uploader developer guide","keywords":"","body":"Tidepool uploader developer guide\nAs you're getting ready to develop code in this repository, we recommend starting with the following documents:\n\noverview of features\napp & directory structure\narchitecture\ncode style\napplication state\ndriver checklists\n\n"},"docs/guide/FeatureOverview.html":{"url":"docs/guide/FeatureOverview.html","title":"Overview of features","keywords":"","body":"Overview of features\nComing soon!\n"},"docs/guide/DirectoryStructure.html":{"url":"docs/guide/DirectoryStructure.html","title":"App & directory structure","keywords":"","body":"App & directory structure\nComing soon!\n"},"docs/guide/Architecture.html":{"url":"docs/guide/Architecture.html","title":"Architecture","keywords":"","body":"Architecture\nComing soon!\n"},"docs/guide/CodeStyle.html":{"url":"docs/guide/CodeStyle.html","title":"Code style","keywords":"","body":"Code style\nSee the section of the README dedicated to this topic as well as the general React @ Tidepool guide for React-specific style and best practices.\n"},"docs/state/":{"url":"docs/state/","title":"Application state via Redux","keywords":"","body":"The uploader's usage of Redux for application state management\nAs of February of 2016, we have migrated the application state (including UI state) management in the Tidepool Uploader to Redux.

Uploader's State Tree\nPreliminary\n\nPWD: Person With Diabetes (or, conveniently enough for us at Tidepool, Person With Data). Used as a shorthand for a user that has a Tidepool account with data storage, as opposed to a Tidepool user (such as a clinic worker, diabetes educator, endocrinologist etc.) whose account is not set up for data storage.\n\nUser-Related State\nAll the state that is driven by user information and/or the login process is handled in the reducers in lib/redux/reducers/users.js.\nallUsers\nThe allUsers property is an object keyed by the user IDs of the logged-in user as well as all the PWDs the logged-in user has permissions to upload for. The information stored under each userID is all the account and profile information accessible to the logged-in user for that user.\nIn essence, the allUsers object is where all user information accessible to the logged-in user is stored. Keeping all this information in one place keyed by userId allows us to only reference users by userId elsewhere in the state tree, thus maintaining a \"normalized\" state tree with a single source of truth for user-related information. (Cf. Dan Abramov's presentation of the \"normalization\" problem in the README for his normalizr library.) Whenever a component needs additional information (that is, beyond userId) about a user, that information can be retrieved via lookup under the userId.\nExamples of properties that may be encoded in allUsers for a particular user include fullName, emails, a patient object that itself includes the PWD's birthday and diagnosisData. Also see the example state tree for full examples.\nloggedInUser\nThe property loggedInUser encodes the userID of the currently logged-in user.\nIf no user is (yet) logged in, the value of loggedInUser is null.\nloginErrorMessage\nThe property loginErrorMessage encodes the error message if there is an error on an attempt to log in.\nIf there has not (yet) been a login attempt or login proceeded without error, the value of loginErrorMessage is null.\nupdateProfileErrorMessage\nThe property updateProfileErrorMessage encodes the error message if there is an error on an attempt to update the user's profile information.\nIf there has not (yet) been an error updating profile information or profile information update proceeded without error, the value of updateProfileErrorMessage is null.\nupdateProfileErrorDismissed\nThe property updateProfileErrorDismissed  is a flag indicating whether the user has dismissed the displayed uploadProfileErrorMessage. \nIf the user has not dismissed the error or if there has been no error to dismiss, the value of updateProfileErrorDismissed is null. If the user has dismissed an existing error, the value is true.\ncreateCustodialAccountErrorMessage\nThe property createCustodialAccountErrorMessage encodes the error message if there is an error on an attempt to create a new custodial account.\nIf there has not (yet) been an error creating a custodial account or account creation proceeded without error, the value of createCustodialAccountErrorMessage is null.\ncreateCustodialAccountErrorDismissed\nThe property createCustodialAccountErrorDismissed  is a flag indicating whether the user has dismissed the displayed createCustodialAccountErrorMessage. \nIf the user has not dismissed the error or if there has been no error to dismiss, the value of createCustodialAccountErrorDismissed is false. If the user has dismissed an existing error, the value is true.\ntargetDevices\nThe property targetDevices is an object keyed by the user IDs of all the PWDs the logged-in user has permissions to upload for (including the logged-in user, if applicable). The information stored under each userId is an array of the deviceKeys selected for that user as potential sources of data to upload to the Tidepool cloud.\ntargetTimezones\nThe property targetTimezones is an object keyed by the user IDs of all the PWDs the logged-in user has permissions to upload for (including the logged-in user, if applicable). The information stored under each userId is a string timezone name (from the IANA Time Zone Database by way of the Moment Timezone JavaScript library).\nIn the future we plan to support the possibility of selecting a timezone for each device a user has selected as a source of data to upload to Tidepool. When we introduce such support, we will change the value of the information stored under each userId in targetTimezones to an object keyed by the deviceKeys selected by the user.\ntargetUsersForUpload\nThe property targetUsersForUpload is an array consisting of the userIds of all the PWDs the logged-in user has permissions to upload for (including the logged-in user, if applicable).\nThis array drives the user selection dropdown menu that provides the interface for setting and changing the uploadTargetUser.\nuploadTargetUser\nThe propery uploadTargetUser encodes the userId (for lookup in the allUsers branch of the state tree) of the PWD currently selected as the target for data upload.\nThe combination of uploadTargetUser and uploadTargetDevice provides the path into uploadsByUser to the upload currently in progress, if any.\n\n(Current) Upload-Related State\nAll the state that is driven by the current (i.e., in progress) or recent upload(s) is handled in the reducers in lib/redux/reducers/uploads.js.\nuploadProgress\nThe uploadProgress property is an object with two keys: percentage to record the percentage towards completion of the current upload in progress and step to encode the current step in the upload sequence (e.g., device detection, device read, POSTing data to the Tidepool data ingestion API).\nWhen there is not an upload in progress, the value of uploadProgress is null.\nuploadsByUser\nThe uploadsByUser property is an object keyed by the user IDs of all the PWDs the logged-in user has permissions to upload for (including the logged-in user, if applicable). Within each user ID is another object keyed by the devices that user has selected to upload data from, if any. The information stored at each userId, deviceKey path is semi-ephemeral information about the state of current and recent uploads.\nOne example of a property that is encoded in the object at the termination of each userId, deviceKey path is the history of the user's uploading for that device, which is an array of objects with up to a maximum of start and finish timestamps and a boolean error to encode whether the upload was successful. Other examples are additional boolean flags regarding the upload's state: completed, failed, successful, and uploading. If an upload failed due to an error, the error object itself is included in an error field. For block-mode devices, there are additional flags and fields such as boolean flags for choosingFile and readingFile and file object encoding the name and data from a selected file.\nuploadTargetDevice\nThe property uploadTargetDevice encodes the key (for lookup in the devices branch of the state tree) of the device currently being uploaded when an upload is in progress.\nWhen an upload is not in progress, the value of uploadTargetDevice is null. The combination of uploadTargetUser and uploadTargetDevice provides the path into uploadsByUser to the upload currently in progress, if any.\n\nAll Other App State\nAll other app state is handled in the reducers in lib/redux/reducers/misc.js.\nblipUrls\nThe property blipUrls is an object with three properties: forgotPassword, signUp, and viewDataLink, all URLs for Tidepool's webapp blip.\nThe forgotPassword and signUp links are built as part of the app initialization step for the configured or chosen server environment (the default is production).\nThe viewDataLink is built every time the uploadTargetUser is chosen or changed.\nNB: Storing these URLs as state is not ideal. Both the forgot password and sign-up URLs are essentially derived state - derived from a combination of route paths (e.g., /signup), which are constants, and a single piece of state - the server environment. The viewDataLink is also derived state from a combination of route paths, the server environment, and the uploadTargetUser. For now, we are keeping these URLs in the state tree because we do not represent the server environment in the state tree. We don't represent the server environment in the state tree because we have code running separately from the main application (in the Chrome App's \"background page\") that provides a hidden interface (for internal Tidepool use) for changing the server environment.\ndevices\nThe devices property on the state tree is an object keyed by the id of each device (or data source) supported by the Tidepool Uploader.\n devices almost does not belong in the state tree at all, because it is almost a constant. However, it is subject to filtering based on operating system; this filtering happens as part of the app initialization step when a user launches the Tidepool Uploader. The property enabled - itself an object with mac and win as its keys - encodes the devices Tidepool currently support on each platform. Similarly, the property showDriverLink encodes, for each device, whether the Tidepool USB driver is required in order to upload the device on each platform.\nThe properties of each \"device\" in devices should be fairly self-explanatory. For example, the instructions property stores the text that appears in the UI under each device name to give the user some indication of how to proceed (e.g., what type of cable is required to connect a particular device).\ndropdown\nThe Tidepool Uploader inclues a dropdown menu, which is accessible after logging in by clicking on the area where the logged-in user's name is displayed in the upper-right corner. The property dropdown in the state tree encodes whether this menu is currently in its open (dropped-down) state (true) or closed and hidden (false).\npage\nThe property page encodes the current \"page\" of the application that is active. Possible values are, for example, SETTINGS for the device selection \"page\" and MAIN for the main upload interface shown in the app snapshot.\nSince the Tidepool Uploader is a Chrome App that runs outside of the browser environment and thus does not have URL-based navigation, we use the simple page variable and nothing more to record the state that in a browser-based single-page app might be managed by a larger, more robust routing solution such as React Router. As the functionality in the uploader grows - and especially if the addition of back and forward navigation buttons is planned - we may revisit this decision and bring in a more featureful single-page app routing solution.\nunsupported\nThe propery unsupported encodes whether the running version of the Tidepool Uploader is outdated from the perspective of Tidepool's data ingestion API. This property defaults to true; in other words, any instance of the uploader is assumed to be outdated and unsupported until it proves itself otherwise.\nTo ensure the highest possible standards of data quality, it is very important for us at Tidepool to prevent uploaders that have been succeeded by newer versions from uploading to the Tidepool cloud. To this end, we have implemented an \"info\" endpoint on our data ingestion API that responds with (among other things) the minimum version of the Tidepool Uploader that the data ingestion API will accept data from.\nworking\nThe working property is an object with a small handful of keys that record the app's current state with respect to certain asynchronous actions.\nThe properties initializingApp (which defaults to true) and checkingVersion serve to prevent rendering the warning message about the Tidepool Uploader being unsupported before the application has finished checking against the Tidepool data ingestion API to determine whether it is outdated and unsupported. (See unsupported above, taking care to note that unsupported defaults to true, so without some other indicator(s) of the app's state with respect to validation of the current version against the Tidepool data ingestion API, the \"uploader unsupported\" warning message would render immediately.)\nThe property fetchingUserInfo is used to render a \"Logging in...\" message after a user's credentials have been submitted but the uploader is still waiting for a (complete) response from the Tidepool platform with the logged-in user's information.\nFinally, the property uploading is used to disable certain UI features while an upload is in progress. When uploading is true, the dropdown menu for selecting the uploadTargetUser as well as the link to \"Choose devices\" in the dropdown menu are disabled until the current upload is completed, as changing the target user for upload and/or the devices chosen for upload while an upload is in progress for a particular user and device is not supported behavior.\n"},"docs/state/CustomMiddleware.html":{"url":"docs/state/CustomMiddleware.html","title":"Custom middleware","keywords":"","body":"Custom Middleware\nOne of the great benefits of redux is the easy path it provides for writing middleware to perform various actions in response to some or all of the redux actions that are the source of all changes to the application's state tree. The open-source community provides some great middleware options like the redux logger that we include behind an environment variable to assist in development.\nIn the Tidepool Uploader, we also include two custom middlewares: one for making calls to our metrics API and one for logging application errors.\nThe source for the metrics middleware is found in lib/redux/utils/metrics.js. It performs a call to the Tidepool metrics API for any redux action that includes a metric property inside its meta property.\nThe source of the error-logging middleware is found in lib/redux/utils/errors.js. It performs a call to the Tidepool server-side error logging for any redux action that has the boolean flag error as true and a JavaScript Error object as its payload.\nIf the source code of our custom middlewares confuses more than it answers questions, we recommended reading the excellent intro to middleware included in the redux documentation.\n"},"docs/checklisttemplates/":{"url":"docs/checklisttemplates/","title":"checklist TEMPLATES","keywords":"","body":"Templates of checklists for implementations of drivers to read data from diabetes devices.\n\nblood glucose meters (BGMs)\ncontinuous glucose monitors (CGMs)\ninsulin pumps\n\n"},"docs/checklisttemplates/BGMChecklist.html":{"url":"docs/checklisttemplates/BGMChecklist.html","title":"BGM Checklist","keywords":"","body":"Checklist for Blood Glucose Meter Implementation\n(Key:\n\n[x] available in data protocol/documented in spec and implemented\n[-] available in data protocol/documented in spec but not yet implemented\n[?] unknown whether available in data protocol/documented in spec; not yet implemented\n*[ ] TODO: needs implementation!\n[ ] unavailable in data protocol and/or not documented in spec and not yet implemented)\n\nRequired if Present\n\n[ ] smbg values\n[ ] units of smbg values (read from device, not hard-coded)\n[ ] out-of-range values (LO or HI)\n[ ] out-of-range value thresholds (e.g., often 20 for low and 600 for high on BGMs)\n[ ] date & time settings changes\n[ ] blood ketone values\n[ ] units of blood ketone values (read from device, not hard-coded)\n[ ] ketone out-of-range values\n[ ] ketone out-of-range value thresholds\n\nNo Tidepool Data Model Yet\n\n[ ] control (solution) tests (whether marked in UI or auto-detected) - until we have a data model, these should be discarded\n[ ] device settings, other than date & time (e.g., target blood glucose range)\n[ ] tag/note (e.g., pre- vs. post-meal)\n\nTidepool ingestion API\nChoose one of the following:\n\n[ ] legacy \"jellyfish\" ingestion API\n[ ] platform ingestion API\n\nKnown implementation issues/TODOs\nUse this space to describe device-specific known issues or implementation TODOs not contained in the above datatype-specific sections.\n"},"docs/checklisttemplates/CGMChecklist.html":{"url":"docs/checklisttemplates/CGMChecklist.html","title":"CGM Checklist","keywords":"","body":"Checklist for CGM Implementation\n(Key:\n\n[x] available in data protocol/documented in spec and implemented\n[-] available in data protocol/documented in spec but not yet implemented\n[?] unknown whether available in data protocol/documented in spec; not yet implemented\n*[ ] TODO: needs implementation!\n[ ] unavailable in data protocol and/or not documented in spec and not yet implemented)\n\nRequired if Present\nCBG\n\n[ ] cbg values\n[ ] units of cbg values (read from device, not hard-coded)\n[ ] out-of-range values (LO or HI)\n[ ] out-of-range value thresholds (e.g., often 40 for low and 400 for high on CGMs)\n\nDevice-specific?

Because we are correlating data from many different sources for each user, we rely on UTC time as the absolute scale on which to place all the time series data ingested by the Tidepool platform.\nTimezoneOffsetUtil\nThe module in lib/TimezoneOffsetUtil.js is our best effort to \"bootstrap\" from device local time (deviceTime) to true UTC from a combination of three sources of information:\n\nthe timezone that applies to the device user's most recent data on the device (selected by the device user in the uploader UI at the time of upload)\n\nthe timestamp of the most recent datum on the device\n\nthe set of changes to the date & time settings on the device\n\n\nIn combination (because timezones and timezone offsets from UTC do not map 1:1 due to Daylight Savings Time, see Timezone Basics below), the timezone and most recent timestamp allow us to determine the offset from UTC (in minutes) of the most recent data on the device. We then follow the set of date & time settings changes on the device backwards from the most recent data to the earliest data on the device, adjusting the offset used to convert device local time into UTC according to the settings changes. This method produces a more accurate conversion to UTC than applying a timezone across-the-board because it properly accounts for travel across timezones, as well as doing a better job of representing the changes to and from Daylight Savings Time since this \"bootstrapping\" to UTC [henceforth: BtUTC] does not assume that a device user changes the device time at precisely the moment of change to or from Daylight Savings Time.\nIn its current version, BtUTC now keeps track of three offsets from UTC - a timezoneOffset (see Timezone Basics below) a conversionOffset, and a clockDriftOffset. Some date & time settings changes in a device's history factor into updates to the stored conversionOffset or clockDriftOffset, while others affect the stored timezoneOffset. This is to preserve the semantics of the timezoneOffset field to match as closely as possible to the concept of what timezone offsets actually are. The original version of BtUTC only stored a timezoneOffset because it was primarily concerned with solving only the two most common use cases for device time changes on diabetes devices:\n\nchanges resulting from the shift to or from Daylight Savings Time, in timezones where DST is observed\nchanges resulting from travel across timezones\n\nThese changes are interpreted appropriately as changes to the stored timezoneOffset on each datum.\nThe conversionOffset was introduced because it became clear through the course of testing that there is a third collection of use cases that it is equally vital for BtUTC to cover - namely, changes resulting from incorrect set up of a device, including the device being set (from the first use of the device or only for a short period at some point in the history of the device's usage) to the wrong datetime entirely, including:\n\ndevice set to the wrong a.m. or p.m.\ndevice set to the wrong day\ndevice set to the wrong month\ndevice set to the wrong year\n\nThe bottom two of these changes (device set to wrong month or wrong year) are only reflected in the stored conversionOffset on each datum. In a perfect world, BtUTC would also only adjust the conversionOffset (but not the timezoneOffset) for the top two, but it is unfortunately impossible to distinguish a settings change +/- 12 hours because of the device being set to the wrong a.m. or p.m. from travel across 12 hours worth of timezones. Similarly for when a device is set to the wrong day. The only consequence of this is that the timezoneOffset stored on (a subset of) a user's data will not always line up correctly with the timezone(s) the user was actually in when the data was generated. We aren't trying to infer the timezone(s) of data generation (which would not be an easy task, due to the lack of a 1:1 mapping between timezones and timezone offsets), so this is an acceptable consequence. The only timezone information we store, in fact, is the timezone selected by the user at the time of upload reflecting the timezone of the most recent data on the device about to be uploaded.\nFinally, the clockDriftOffset was introduced to handle:\n\nsmall changes (\nfor any change interpreted as a change to the timezoneOffset, the difference between the offset change rounded to the nearest thirty minutes (again, this is to preserve the semantics of the timezoneOffset field as far as is possible) and the raw offset change\n\nAt one point, we simply included the clockDriftOffset as part of the conversionOffset and used both conversionOffset and timezoneOffset to convert between time and deviceTime. This had several undesirable side-effects, including the fact that factoring in every small device display time change a user makes results in the appearance of a drift away from start and end times of basal rate segments on exact hour, half-hour, etc. intervals. For a more detailed discussion of the clockDriftOffset, see Adjustments for \"Clock Drift\" below.\nUsage\nEach device driver - even those for devices that do not allow retrieval of date & time settings changes - should integrate TimezoneOffsetUtil as the common way of generating the time, timezoneOffset, conversionOffset, and clockDriftOffset fields on each datum. For example, each driver should (1) import the utility:\nvar TZOUtil = require('lib/TimezoneOffsetUtil');\n\n(2) initialize it with the information required to determine the initial timezoneOffset - that is, the user-selected timezone (timezone) and the UTC timestamp of the most recent datum from the device's history (mostRecent). At this time, an array of the date & time settings changes from the device's history (changes) should also be provided as the third argument to the constructor. If the device does not store date & time settings changes (as many/all BGMs do not), then just an empty array should be passed.\ncfg.tzoUtil = new TZOUtil(timezone, mostRecent, changes);\n\n(3) employ the utility's fillInUTCInfo to fill in the time, timezoneOffset, conversionOffset, and clockDriftOffset on data that already have two pieces of time-related information attached: (a) the deviceTime as a string (datum.deviceTime) and (b) an index (datum.index) representing the event's position in the sequence of all events that occurred on the device, where such indices are monotonically increasing from earliest datum to latest. The fillInUTCInfo method expects a second argument as well - a jsDate, which is a JavaScript Date object resulting from parsing the device's native datetime format using sundial.buildTimestamp or sundial.parseFromFormat (usually this is the object used to produce deviceTime via sundial.formatDeviceTime, and we provide it as an additional argument to avoid re-parsing the deviceTime, as parsing time strings is rather expensive).\n_.each(data, function(datum) {\n  cfg.tzoUtil.fillInUTCInfo(datum, jsDate);\n});\n\nEach instance of the TimezoneOffsetUtil keeps track of which method for generating the time field is being employed - either across-the-board application of a timezone (when no date & time settings changes were provided to the constructor) or \"bootstrapping\" to UTC. The method of time generation is publicly available through the type property on the instance (i.e., cfg.tzoUtil.type) and must be retrieved and provided as the timeProcessing field of the upload metadata.\nExpectations for timeChange events\nThe partially built timeChange events composing the array of changes provided as the third argument to a new TimezoneOffsetUtil instance should have the following listed fields set through use of the uploader's objectBuilder. All timestamps should be ISO 8601-formatted, without timezone offset information - e.g., 2015-01-01T12:00:00.\n\ndeviceTime = timestamp\nchange = an object that itself has the following fields:\nfrom = timestamp\nto = timestamp\nagent = string (optional, can have values such as manual or automatic)\n\n\njsDate = a JavaScript Date constructed from the to time\nindex = an index (with an expectation that all indices be monotonically increasing with event order) for the datum that allows it to be sorted with respect to all other events on the device in the order that the events actually happened (which will not match deviceTime order in the case of date & time settings changes on the device)\n\nThe index does not have to be numerical. For example, in the case of Dexcom data, the index is the Dexcom's internalTime, which is monotonically increasing and never affected by adjustments to the Dexcom's date & time settings.\nThe array of changes does not need to be sorted before passing it into the TimezoneOffsetUtil constructor. The changes will be mutated by the TimezoneOffsetUtil:\n\ntime will be added (the true UTC timestamp)\ntimezoneOffset will be added\nconversionOffset will be added\nclockDriftOffset will be added\njsDate will be deleted\n\n(As a historical aside: the choice to mutate the timeChange events makes for a somewhat deceptive and/or opaque API, but this was felt to be a better choice than repeating the same code (effecting the mutations described above) across all the device drivers. We may change this in the future.)\nThe fillInUTCInfo method from the usage example above also mutates the object passed as its first argument, adding time, timezoneOffset, conversionOffset, and clockDriftOffset fields. An annotation may additionally be added if no index was provided on the object, which results in uncertainty in the determination of the correct UTC timestamp. (Some diabetes devices do not provide a monotonically increasing index on all events in the device history.)\nAssumptions\nIn this section, we outline the assumptions that TimezoneOffsetUtil currently makes. These may change - or may become configurable - in the future.\nDefaulting to Across-the-Board Timezone Application\nSome devices that Tidepool supports or plans to support do not provide date & time settings changes in the device data protocol; at present, all such devices Tidepool knows about are traditional fingerstick blood glucose meters. For these devices, there is no way to use the same BtUTC strategy, and so when TimezoneOffsetUtil is initialized with an empty array for changes (because there are no date & time settings changes in the device data), it defaults to across-the-board application of the specified timezone to convert local device time into UTC time. This means that for users who travel extensively (and change the display time on all their diabetes devices when they do so), if they view their data in a timezone-aware display (rather than a display that visualizes data according to local device time), the data from their different devices may not always be aligned properly due to some of their devices' timestamps being converted to UTC via across-the-board application of a timezone and some via BtUTC.\nEven for devices from which Tidepool is able to extract date & time settings changes, if there are no date & time settings changes in the data extracted from the device during a particular upload session, then the across-the-board timezone application strategy will still come into play as the default. This should produce accurate UTC timestamps as long as the correct timezone is selected by the user of the device on upload.\nAdjustments for \"Clock Drift\"\nTimezoneOffsetUtil does not assume that every change to the date & time settings on the device should result in a change to the timezoneOffset stored on each datum; settings changes that do not look like timezone-related changes (i.e., plausibly to/from DST or travel across timezones) instead result in changes to the stored conversionOffset or clockDriftOffset. As described above, very large changes (wrong month, wrong year, etc.) are factored into the conversionOffset. On the other hand, very small changes are factored into the clockDriftOffset.\nDiabetes devices often suffer from \"clock drift,\" and some users are in the habit of regularly correcting this drift on their devices. \"Clock drift\" adjustments can also happen unintentionally due to the way that device UIs often work, allowing the user to set only the hour and minutes in the display time, such that changes the user makes will almost never be precisely x number of hours earlier or later, but rather x + some seconds. That difference of seconds will be perceived by the BtUTC code as \"clock drift\" adjustment. Since the correction to the drift does not represent a change to or from Daylight Savings Time or a change in timezone, it is not a change that we are particularly interested in tracking in the timezoneOffset, and in fact it would be detrimental to track it if we want to preserve the potential for associating timezones with the timezoneOffsets stored in the data. (Such association could be done via user interaction - e.g., a pop-up with the text: \"You changed the time on your device here. Were you traveling? Please select a timezone from these possibilities.\")\nOf course, a threshold had to be chosen to decide what amount of display date & time settings change counts as \"clock drift\" and what amount doesn't. Because there are a few fractional timezones in the world with offsets at the granularity of fifteen minutes - e.g., New Zealand's Chatham Islands (timezone 'Pacific/Chatham' at UTC+12:45) - we at first chose to round all date & time settings changes to the nearest fifteen minutes for the purpose of determining changes to the timezoneOffset, so any change that was eight minutes or larger was interpreted as a change to the timezoneOffset, while any change less than eight minutes was interpreted as \"clock drift\" and only reflected in an adjustment to the clockDriftOffset. This threshold turned out to be too low; we have had problems reported by users whose data included \"clock drift\" date & time settings changes of greater than eight minutes. Accordingly, we now round time changes to the nearest thirty minutes for the purposes of determining the timezoneOffset and consider any change of less than fifteen minutes to constitute a \"clock drift\" adjustment.\n When a user adjusts the \"clock drift\" at the same time as making a change related to DST or travel across timezones, we factor the (rounded) value of the change into the timezoneOffset and the (positive or negative) remainder into the clockDriftOffset.\nClock Drift Offset Starts at Zero\nAnother assumption built into the current code is that the clockDriftOffset starts at zero for the most recent data on the device being uploaded. In reality, this is a simplifying assumption; in the vast majority of cases, there is probably a small (within seconds or minutes) difference between the user's device time and the computer time at the time of upload. If we wanted to be extraordinarily precise about the UTC timestamps stored for every datum, we would correct for this difference between device time and computer time immediately, starting with a clockDriftOffset equal to the difference between the two. The main thing stopping us from doing this is the fact that we don't yet have a robust enough interface for distinguishing between device time, computer time, device timezone, and computer timezone.\nPut another way, what's essential for this initial release of BtUTC is that the user selects the timezone that applies to the most recent data on their device, even if that is not the user's current timezone (e.g., user travels from California to Florida, leaving all their diabetes devices in Pacific time but uploading from Florida; in this instance we want the user to select 'Pacific' as the timezone that applies to their most recent data and we would not want to correct for the 3+ hour difference between device time and computer time).\nUpper Threshold for Timezone Offset Changes\nIn rare but certainly not unheard-of instances, a diabetes device user sets the time on the device to the entirely wrong month or year and later must correct it. We do not interpret such massive changes to the date & time settings on the device as an adjustment to the timezoneOffset. Rather, whenever the absolute value of a date & time settings change, rounded to the nearest fifteen minutes, is larger than the maximum difference possible by traveling between timezones (1560 minutes between UTC-12:00 and UTC+14:00), we apply this change (unrounded) as an adjustment to the conversionOffset and keep the same timezoneOffset.\nTimezone Basics\nIt is vitally important in the context of complex time-processing code like the above-described BtUTC to have a good understanding of all the relevant terms and use them precisely. So here is a small glossary, just in case these concepts are new:\ntimezone\nA timezone is a string naming a valid timezone from the IANA Time Zone Database. Some examples are US/Pacific or Pacific/Auckland. You can see many more examples by hovering over the map on Moment Timezone's landing page. In many cases a timezone does not map 1:1 with a timezone offset to UTC because of Daylight Savings Time. For example, the timezone US/Eastern has an offset to UTC of 300 (UTC is 300 minutes ahead of US/Eastern) when Daylight Savings is not in effect, but an offset to UTC of 240 when Daylight Savings is in effect.\ntimezone offset\nA timezone offset is an integer, positive or negative, giving the number of minutes of offset required to translate a local datetime into UTC. JavaScript Date and the Moment Timezone library specify timezone offsets to UTC from the local datetime, so the offsets are positive for the North American timezones, which are behind UTC time - that is, you need to add hours to get from local time to UTC time. In our data model, we store timezone offsets as minutes from UTC, so the offsets are negative for the North American timezones, reflecting the fact that you need to subtract hours from UTC to get the local time. While this choice goes against the grain of how timezone offsets are represented in JavaScript, it agrees with the ISO 8601 international standard for representation of dates and times.\nOverall, the relationship between the fields deviceTime, time, and timezoneOffset in the Tidepool data model can be generalized as follows (assuming all appropriate unit conversions have been made):\ndeviceTime = time + timezoneOffset\nIn the second version of BtUTC we are adding a conversionOffset to the data model to handle a wider range of use cases, and so the new generalization is:\ndeviceTime = time + timezoneOffset + conversionOffset\nIn the most current (and production) version of BtUTC, this generalization has not changed, despite the addition of the clockDriftOffset. Another way of putting this is to say that we store clockDriftOffset for data auditing and provenance only, at least at this point in time.\nfinding a timezone offset\nIf you don't have the timezone offset for a particular datum and you want to find it, you need two pieces of information:\n\nthe local timezone (name)\nthe local datetime OR the UTC time\n\nThis is because again, timezones do not map to timezone offsets 1:1, so some other anchor is needed to decide which offset associated with a named timezone to map to, when there is more than one option. Either the local datetime or the true UTC time for the datum can serve as this anchor.\nThe reverse is also true: timezone offsets do not map to timezones 1:1. For example, in the United States, Arizona does not participate in DST. It has a timezone offset of 420 minutes to UTC year-round, while neighboring geographical areas in the US/Mountain timezone (e.g., New Mexico) share the same offset when DST is not in effect but have an offset of 360 minutes to UTC when DST is in effect. So the offset of 420 is ambiguous between at least two timezones (and actually more, when you consider Canadian and South American timezones as well).\ntimezone offset abbreviations\nThere is a set of (mostly?) three-letter codes used to abbreviate timezone + timezone offset information. For example, PDT refers to the US/Pacific timezone under Daylight Savings Time, which is an offset of 420 minutes to UTC, while PST refers to the same timezone when DST is not in effect (the S in PST is for \"standard\" time), an offset of 480 minutes to UTC. It is important to keep these abbreviations distinct from timezone names. Don't use an abbreviation where a timezone is requested, and vice versa.\nDaylight Savings Time\nThere is way too much history and complication on this topic to introduce it here concisely. If you don't know what Daylight Savings Time is, try the wikipedia article for it.\nFor our purposes, all that is important to understand is the following:\n\nDST is responsible for the lack of a 1:1 mapping between timezones and timezone offsets\ndifferent countries around the world (and in different hemispheres!) change to and from DST at different dates and times\n\n"},"docs/misc/CSSModules.html":{"url":"docs/misc/CSSModules.html","title":"use of CSS modules","keywords":"","body":"CSS modules\nCSS what?\nFor a quick breakdown on what CSS modules are, check out Glen Maddern's post  which summarizes pretty well.\nHow they're used here\nCSS modules allow for module-scoped styling for components. This is done by requireing the styles file and allowing the Webpack CSS loader to process the file as a module. Since there are some styles that need to remain global (mainly webfonts and styles for 3rd party components), we selectively use the CSS module loader through a naming convention of .module.less for modules vs simply .less for a non-CSS-module Webpack loader chain.\nWhenever a .module.less file is required, it will be passed through the CSS module loader and have all it's class names transformed and exported. CSS modules also have a mechanism for extending and sharing class names across files through the composes keyword. Any file that is referenced by a compose will also be processed as a CSS module, regardless of file extension. In this way, we can use a normal .less file in a compose and gain the benefit of scoped, shared style classes while still letting the styles be used in a more traditional context as necessary (like being referenced though a LESS extend which would break if class names were transformed). In the following example, coolText.less will be processed and have a scoped form of neatStyle generated (something like coolText_neatStyle__3woeh) which will be paired with the scoped form of awesomeClass in the CSS module export list.\n.awesomeClass {\n  composes: neatStyle from '../coolText.less'\n}\n\nIn general, all of the components will have a .module.less as the styles are required from within the JavaScript of the component. The files under /styles/core are a slightly mixed bag as they aren't generally required individually from a JavaScript file (excepting main.less). The files in /core marked as modules don't use any module-incompatible LESS syntax features and are intended to be used as single-responsibility modules solely through the composes keyword from other .module.less files. The plain .less files can be used through composes, but for one reason or another require the ability to be used in a global context in addition to a scoped context and therefore cannot be exclusively loaded by the Webpack CSS module loader.\nConcerning classnames\nWhen creating names for classes in a CSS module, it's good to keep in mind the final use for the file. If one is going to be requireing the file for inclusion in a JavaScript module, then a good practice is to keep all the names camelCase in order to ease addressing them in React/JSX components. For example,\n.classOne {\n  color: #BADA55;\n}\n.class-two {\n  color: #C0FFEE;\n}\n\nIn order to use these class names in JSX it would look something like this:\nOne\nTwo\n\nwhere the first is less cumbersome.\nIf the module that you're creating will be a single-responsibility module (like typography or layout) and will only ever have it's class names referenced by external composes from other modules, then the advantage of the JSX syntax simplicity isn't present. If there's some reason to not use camelCase (e.g. legacy code or third party dependency) then it may make more sense to use another naming scheme. In general, for consistency, default to camelCase when possible.\n"},"docs/misc/PWDSimulators.html":{"url":"docs/misc/PWDSimulators.html","title":"PWD \"simulators\"","keywords":"","body":"Background\nIn order to be future-compatible with Bluetooth-enabled devices that may communicate with the Tidepool platform in real-time (and/or AP remote telemetry systems), the jellyfish API and Tidepool platform ingestion data model are designed for real-time data ingestion. The data we currently read out of CareLink CSV files or directly from devices consists entirely of retrospective records, and this presents some data ingestion challenges. Our current strategy for adapting these retrospective records to our real-time data model and ingestion API is to build a PWD (\"person with diabetes\") \"simulator\" for each device/source from which we are able to extract data. The simulator processes the retrospective records and then adds them to an array of records - in strict sequential order; the array is then POSTed to jellyfish. The idea here is that the simulator creates a array that represents a \"play back\" of all the events that happened on the pump, in the form we would expect if the device had been communicating with the platform in real-time. We simply upload them all batched together ex post facto instead of individually in real-time.\nDrivers (pre-simulator)\nThe device driver is the (obvious) first step in data processing. The driver for each device extracts the raw data and begins the process of building the JavaScript objects that will become the JSON objects uploaded to jellyfish.\nEvery device driver should be configured with an instance of the objectBuilder (often referred to just as the 'builder' and stored in cfg.builder). An instance of the builder contains functions for building every type (or sub-type) of object in the ingestion data model; these functions contain some built-in validation for required fields, but not for the contents of any (optional or required) field(s).\nIn the cases of datatypes that are simple, point-in-time events that do not meaningfully interact with other events (for example, smbg readings), all of the building of the corresponding Tidepool JavaScript objects should be done in the device driver. There may be exceptions, but in many cases the following types will fall into this category:\n\ncbg\nbloodKetone and urineKetone\ndeviceEvent: sub-types alarm, calibration, reservoirChange, prime, and timeChange\nsettings\nsmbg\n\nWhether bolus and wizard events can be completely built in the simulator depends on how the connections between these events are represented and how early termination of a bolus is represented.\nSome datatypes are not point-in-time (e.g., a basal represents a rate of insulin delivery over an interval of time) and/or interact with other events, as the status sub-type of deviceEvent events do (these represent suspensions and resumes of insulin delivery and thus imply the stopping and starting of basal delivery). The building of these events cannot usually be completed in the device driver, so the general strategy is to start building them in the driver, then pass them to the simulator, where the building is completed before they are uploaded to the Tidepool platform via jellyfish. While there may be exceptions, in many cases the following types will fall into the category of objects that cannot be completely built in a device driver:\n\nbasal - often the duration and sometimes other information, especially in the case of temp basals, needs to be added via the simulator\ndeviceEvent: sub-types status\n\nNB: The general guideline for what tasks can and cannot be done in a device driver with respect to object building is that device drivers should be stateless with respect to the object building they do. For example, the task of saving the last basal rate change recorded by an insulin pump as the currBasal and setting its duration only upon coming across the next basal rate change event is exactly the kind of task the simulator should be doing, not the device driver.\nSimulators\nPWD simulators are, at present, unique to each device we are able to extract data from. Thus far, each device has presented its own unique challenges, particularly with respect to event interplay. For example, the only way to determine the programmed vs. actual insulin delivery when a bolus is interrupted using an Insulet OmniPod insulin delivery system is to feed each bolus event to the simulator and store it in the simulator's state as the current bolus (currBolus), then feed every bolus termination event into the simulator as well, modifying the currBolus with the information from the termination event. This is necessary because the Insulet data format does not include any key to link bolus terminations to their associated boluses; only the order of the events on the pump relates terminations to the boluses terminated.\nThe following are the most common tasks performed in a PWD simulator, grouped by datatype:\n\nbasal\ndetermining and setting duration\ndetermining and setting the suppressed basal object(s) for temp and suspend basals\nadding the previous event\n\n\nbolus\nconnecting normal and square components into a dual-wave bolus where applicable\nconnecting boluses with accompanying wizard events, although this is more commonly accomplished in the device driver\nadding an expectedNormal and/or expectedExtended and expectedDuration when a bolus is terminated early (i.e., bolus volume programmed !== bolus volume delivered)\n\n\ndeviceEvent sub-type status\nadding the previous event\n\n\n\n"},"docs/misc/FlatRateBasals.html":{"url":"docs/misc/FlatRateBasals.html","title":"challenges of flat basal profiles","keywords":"","body":"Flat-Rate Basals\nThe Problem\nMost - if not all - diabetes manufacturers represent basal rate insulin data with basal rate change events (see Terminology below) rather than basal rate intervals. In the particular case where the user of an insulin pump has programmed a flat-rate basal schedule, this means that flat-rate basal rate change events are represented in one of two ways:\n\nThe pump records a basal rate change event every midnight (local device time) when the basal schedule (with its single segment) takes effect, as well as at any other times when the basal rate has changed such as upon the conclusion of a temp basal or on resumption from a suspend event.\n\nThe pump records a basal rate change event only when the basal rate has actually changed, which means only: on first initialization of the schedule and after any temp basals or resumption from a suspend event.\n\n\nThe second representation - only recording basal rate change events when the insulin delivery rate has truly changed - unfortunately poses quite a challenge for any data processing (such as ours at Tidepool) attempting to transform basal rate change events (point-in-time data) to basal rate segments (interval data). The issue is that when determining the duration of a basal rate segment from the user's current settings (as is necessary for the final basal segment in any upload), our general strategy is to only extend the duration of the final segment up to the maximum based on the final basal's matched segment in the schedule - no greater than twenty-four hours on a normal (i.e., not affected by DST) day. If a user has a flat-rate basal, this means we may fail to extend basal data up until the time of upload (if the last rate change was several days prior to upload). In this case, the user will appear to be missing basal data for the most recent day(s) in their upload. One potential solution to this problem is to \"simulate\" basal rate change events at midnight as an aid to producing the correct basal rate segments representing the scheduled delivery for each day. If this strategy is employed, the segments resulting from such fabrication should be given an annotation to record that they are fabricated events.\nTerminology\nbasal rate change: A basal rate change event is a point-in-time data type. It consists of a rate (insulin delivery in units of insulin per hour) and a timestamp.\nbasal (rate) segment: A basal (rate) segment is an interval data type. It consists of a rate (insulin delivery in units of insulin per hour), and either a pair of start and end timestamps or a start timestamp and a duration.\nbasal schedule: A set of basal rate segments that is programmed into an insulin pump. Each basal schedule represents the basal rate(s) (in units of insulin per hour) to be delivered at different times in a standard twenty-four hour day. Thus, each segment of the schedule consists of a rate and a start. The latter is represented as milliseconds from midnight. The first segment of every basal schedule will have a start of 0 (representing midnight). When there is more than one segment in the schedule, the duration of each segment is determined by subtracting the start of the segment in question from the start of the following segment. If there is only one segment in the schedule, it's duration is (normally) 86,400,000 milliseconds (twenty-four hours), but it could be 90,000,000 or 82,800,000 on a (theoretical) device that is timezone-aware and set to a timezone that observes Daylight Savings Time.\n(NB: Various manufacturers use different terms for this - e.g., basal profile. We have chosen basal schedule as our standard term.)\nflat-rate basal (schedule): A flat-rate basal (or more precisely a flat-rate basal schedule) is a basal schedule that consists in only one basal rate segment that operates all twenty-four hours of a normal day.\n"},"docs/misc/2015.06.29CareLinkCSVChanges.html":{"url":"docs/misc/2015.06.29CareLinkCSVChanges.html","title":"2015.06 CareLink CSV updates","keywords":"","body":"Background\nNo later than June 29th, 2015, CareLink updated their CSV format.
