# Tidepool Uploader

This is a Chrome App that acts as an uploader client for Tidepool. It is intended to allow you to plug devices into the USB port and automatically load the data stored on it up to the Tidepool cloud. 

So far, it:

* Displays a UI for you to enter your username and password
* Pretends to log you in and let you log out
